# RORA

** NOTE: ** This application is currently deprecated since both planetScale and the data provider wants to charge me money. Currently rebuilding here: https://github.com/SobczakL/rora-2.0.

Rora is an all-in-one transit app, which allows users access to on-time transit scheduling, community engagement, and payment processing (TBD).

## Usage:

### ** Important to keep in mind **

 - Rora is designed as a mobile app and should be experienced in a mobile view for optimal usage.
 - The API Rora uses has rate limits, allowing only 5 calls per minute. If components are not rendering properly, please wait for a minute and try again.
